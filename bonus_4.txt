Question: Meet with you team to discuss the details of how you are going to approach the group assignment. Write pseudo code for 
every single step in your code. The more details you provide the higher the chance of getting credit for this bonus assignment. 

#Answer:
Team Members: 
- Jessica Hamilton
- Bailey Perosa
- Andrew Paulonis
- James McHale

Approach/ Process:
- We have created a github repo for collaboration
- We will develop the code for model building and tuning with a subset of records
- Execute code at scale
- Examine results
- The bulk of the powerpoint will be completed after we have model results

Pseudo Code: 

#Given code
import tensorflow as tf

import numpy as np
import gzip
import os
os.chdir('/Users/mballin2/Desktop')
def parse(path):
    g = gzip.open(path, 'rb')
    for l in g:
    yield eval(l)

i = 0
df = {}
for d in parse('meta_Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry.json.gz'):
    i += 1
    X = np.array(d['title'])
    print('X (title):\n')
    print(X)
    Y = np.array(d['category'])
    print('\nY (category):\n')
    print(Y)
    if i == 10: #change/remove
        break

establish training/ testing records

#Build model structure
tf inputs
tf layer 1
tf layer 2
tf outputs

#Train/tune model
create model table
# model_id | train_size | test_size | train_time | train_metric | test_metric 
store parameter grid into model table 
loop over other parameters
    start timer
    hyper parameter tuning
    end timer
    generate train/test metrics
    store results into model table
    store training times into model table
compare

export model table to csv

plot results

select best model parameters
create variable importance plots
create partial plots

#export (or copy/paste) plots/charts/metrics for presentation
